## Check out https://get-scatter.com/Apps to see the link of apps.

### Adding new apps

- Create a pull request adding your application to the correct blockchain in the "apps.json" file. 
- **Fill out all of the fields, they are all required.**
- Add your logo to the `logos/` folder ( **.svg format only!** ). Make sure that the logo file's name matches the `applink` that you specified in the JSON. 

```
{
  "applink":"",      // This is the identifier you use when connecting to Scatter
                     // For ScatterJS it is what you pass into ScatterJS.scatter.connect(applink)
                     // It should be only alphanumerical with no special characters or spaces excluding _ - and .
  "name":"",         // This is the name of your application, it should be in Title Case
  "type":"",         // A small tag showing what type of application this is
  "description":"",  // Short description of your application.
  "url":"",          // The URL to your application, or it's landing page.
  "hasimage":"1"     // Adding this specifies that you have added an image to the /images/ directory.
}
```

#### Requesting types
To request the addition of types into Scatter you need to PR both this README as well as the `types.json` file in the root path of this repository.

## Important note about the applink key: 
If you are a web app, you will need to use your FQDN ( ie. get-scatter.com ) and not what you are passing into the connection.
